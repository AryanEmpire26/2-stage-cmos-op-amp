# Differential Op-Amp Simulation Project

## Chapter 1: Introduction
Operational amplifiers (Op-Amps) are widely used in various electronic circuits due to their versatility and efficiency. Differential amplifiers, a specific type of Op-Amp configuration, are particularly useful in applications where the difference between two input voltages needs to be amplified while rejecting common-mode signals.

In this project, we aim to simulate the behavior of a differential Op-Amp circuit using LTspice, a powerful simulation tool commonly employed for electronic circuit design and analysis. Through simulation, we will investigate the performance characteristics of the differential Op-Amp and validate its functionality.
